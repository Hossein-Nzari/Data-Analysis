This repository includes two projects in data science and data analysis.

# Beijing House Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of real estate data for homes in the city of Beijing. We perform comprehensive and insightful analyses on this dataset and present the results through the creation of informative visualizations and graphs.

The project is divided into four main sections:

1. **Data Reading and Preprocessing**
   - In this section, we read the data and remove unnecessary columns. We also address missing values in the dataset.

2. **Data Formatting and Outlier Handling**
   - The second part involves formatting the columns into the appropriate data types and removing outliers in the data.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - In the third section, we leverage the existing features to create new ones that will be crucial in the following two steps.

4. **Geospatial Visualization**
   - Using the geographical latitude and longitude of the houses, we visualize them on a map to gain a general overview of the distribution in the region.
