# Data-Analysis
This repository includes two projects in data science and data analysis.

# China Housing Data Analysis Project

This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on real estate data for homes in the city of Beijing. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of the results through various charts and graphs. The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights and patterns from the dataset.

## Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>

The project is structured into four main sections:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

In this section, we read the raw data and clean it by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values. Data is prepared for further analysis.

### 2. Feature Engineering

Data columns are transformed into appropriate formats, and outliers are identified and removed. New features are created using existing ones, which will be crucial for subsequent analysis.

### 3. Geospatial Visualization

Geographical information such as longitude and latitude is leveraged to plot the houses on a map. This visual representation provides a comprehensive overview of the distribution of properties in the city.

### 4. Time Series Analysis

The project concludes with a time series analysis of transaction data. Trends and patterns in transaction times are explored, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the real estate market in Beijing.

## Data Sources

The dataset used for this project contains real estate information for homes in Beijing. It includes details about property characteristics, transaction data, and geographical information.
